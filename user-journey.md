### Problem & trigger
Maya is in New York for a work trip and has one free afternoon. She loves contemporary sculpture and doesn’t want to waste time wandering giant museums before her flight. A quick web search feels generic and overwhelming. She needs to decide two things quickly: which museum—and, once there, which exhibits?

### 1) Picking a museum (Spotlight)
Maya opens MuseMe (she already has a profile) and goes to Spotlight. At the top, “For you” shows six recommendations “Because you liked…” with a small list of the museums she’s highly rated before. Each card includes a cover photo and quick actions (Directions, Save).

- She taps Save on Institute of Contemporary Art to bookmark it.
- She taps Directions to confirm it’s nearby.
- Spotlight aligns with her taste (based on her previous 4–5★ ratings and tags), so she decides to go to ICA.

Optional: If she wants to browse more broadly, she can switch to Browse and search “Institute of Contemporary Art,” using borough/tag filters.

### 2) Deciding what to see (Friends feed for social proof)
Before heading out, Maya checks the Feed to see what friends have visited lately. She spots Emma’s recent visit to ICA with:

- A swipeable photo gallery from Emma’s visit
- The exhibits Emma saw
- Emma’s star ratings and a short note

That subtle social signal seals it—those exhibits look great, and Maya decided to text Emma to ask for tips about visiting. If Maya taps the museum name from a feed item, a popup shows the museum card with image, actions (Save/Unsave), and links. Maya clicks the website link to buy tickets to the museum.

### 3) Logging the visit (and review)
After visiting ICA, Maya opens the Visits page (Showcase) and taps Add Visit.

- She selects ICA from the museum list.
- She gives an overall museum rating and optional note.
- She picks the exhibits she saw from the ICA list.
- For each selected exhibit, she:
  - Adds a per-exhibit star rating and a quick note
  - Uploads photos

She submits the visit. Her reviews and exhibit entries are saved and linked to that visit. Now her friends can see her visit.

### 4) Profile
Back home, Maya wants to show her roommate Christina what she saw.

- She opens Profile
- Under Reviews, her new ICA visit review appears. She now clicks on Showcase. She sees her recent visit and expands it with the chevron toggle to show the exhibits and photos from the day.
- The stats reflect her new activity (exhibits, museums, average rating).
- Christina thinks this is cool, so she downloads MuseMe, creates an account by choosing a username and a password and opens her Profile. She wants to follow Maya to view her future visits. She goes to the following tab and uses the searchable list to type in Maya’s username. Maya follows Christina back and now they are mutuals, highlighted in blue.

Next time they travel, Spotlight will use their latest museum and exhibit ratings to sharpen recommendations even further.

### Outcome
Maya avoided decision fatigue, picked a museum aligned with her taste, and chose exhibits confidently—helped by relevant friend activity. She left with a clean, photo-rich diary entry, saved favorite, and better-tuned future suggestions.
